@article{Lee2005,
abstract = {The nonequispaced or nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) arises in a variety of application areas, including imaging processing and the numerical solution of partial differential equations. In its most general form, it takes as input an irregular sampling of a function and seeks to compute its Fourier transform at a nonuniform sampling of frequency locations. This is sometimes referred to as the NUFFT of type 3. Like the fast Fourier transform, the amount of work required is of the order O(N log N), where N denotes the number of sampling points in both the physical and spectral domains. In this short note, we present the essential ideas underlying the algorithm in simple terms. We also illustrate its utility with application to problems in magnetic resonance imagin and heat flow. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The schemes of this paper are based on a combination of certain analytical considerations with the classical fast Fourier transform and generalize both the forward and backward FFTs. Each of the algorithms requires {\$}O(N\backslashcdot \backslashlog N + N\backslashcdot \backslashlog (1/\backslashvarepsilon )){\$} arithmetic operations, where {\$}\backslashvarepsilon {\$} is the precision of computations and N is the number of nodes.

@article{Greengard2004,
abstract = {The nonequispaced Fourier transform arises in a variety of application areas, from medical imaging to radio astronomy to the numerical solution of partial differential equations. In a typical problem, one is given an irregular sampling of N data in the frequency domain and one is interested in reconstructing the corresponding function in the physical domain. When the sampling is uniform, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) allows this calculation to be computed in O(N log N) operations rather than O(N 2) operations. Unfortunately, when the sampling is nonuniform, the FFT does not apply. Over the last few years, a number of algorithms have been developed to overcome this limitation and are often referred to as nonuniform FFTs (NUFFTs). These rely on a mixture of interpolation and the judicious use of the FFT on an oversampled grid [A. Dutt and V. Rokhlin, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 14 (1993), pp. 1368-1383]. In this paper, we observe that one of the standard interpolation or "gridding" schemes, based on Gaussians, can be accelerated by a significant factor without precomputation and storage of the interpolation weights. This is of particular value in two- and three-dimensional settings, saving either 10 dJV in storage in d dimensions or a factor of about 5-10 in CPU time (independent of dimension).},

@article{Greengard2006,
abstract = {A number of problems in image reconstruction and image processing can be addressed, in principle, using the sinc kernel. Since the sinc kernel decays slowly, however, it is generally avoided in favor of some more local but less precise choice. In this paper, we describe the fast sinc transform, an algorithm which computes the convolution of arbitrarily spaced data with the sinc kernel in O(N logN) operations, where N denotes the number of data points. We briefly discuss its application to the construction of optimal density compensation weights for Fourier reconstruction and to the iterative approximation of the pseudoinverse of the signal equation in MRI.},

abstract = {The nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) generalizes the FFT to off-grid data. Its many applications include image reconstruction, data analysis, and the numerical solution of differential equations. We present FINUFFT, an efficient parallel library for type 1 (nonuniform to uniform), type 2 (uniform to nonuniform), or type 3 (nonuniform to nonuniform) transforms, in dimensions 1, 2, or 3. It uses minimal RAM, requires no precomputation or plan steps, and has a simple interface to several languages. We perform the expensive spreading/interpolation between nonuniform points and the fine grid via a simple new kernel-the ""exponential of semicircle"" e$\backslash$beta $\backslash$surd 1 - x2 in x $\backslash$in [ - 1, 1]-in a cache-aware load-balanced multithreaded implementation. The deconvolution step requires the Fourier transform of the kernel, for which we propose efficient numerical quadrature. For types 1 and 2, rigorous error bounds asymptotic in the kernel width approach the fastest known exponential rate, namely that of the Kaiser-Bessel kernel. We benchmark against several popular CPU-based libraries, showing favorable speed and memory footprint, especially in three dimensions when high accuracy and/or clustered point distributions are desired.},
